Haptic Controller

v.05
optional pull ups on scl and sda
added some caps to regulator lion charger, ftdi, and put cap on reset line
removed one bus connectors
ftdi didn't work-corrected hopefully
added 0805 leds on ftdi, others were impossible to solder
all passive components changed to 0805s
removed bluetooth transistor power switch, just regulated 3.3v always
moved fuse to usb so can pull more than 500ma from battery, will have to rely on over discharge protection in a battery protection circuit? or add another fuse some day
swap switch, old could only do 100ma, should be 1amps to match connectors
made pads on bus connector posts grounds. Hopefully stronger and passes ground around the circuit better
current limiting resistor on bcon line to micro
added 74LVC1G125 to bluetooth/ftdi lines so they share bus better
